FAQ for the same
Our institute has established EYantra Embedded Robotics Laboratory in collaboration with IIT Bombay, where laboratory facilities are available to work in this field. Every year EYRC and EYIC competitions are conducted by EYantra team of IIT Bombay. A group of bright students passing through these levels of competition are given high level internship at IIT Bombay and trained for advance technologies in this field. Every year, students from PVG‚Äùs COET & GKPIOM, Pune participate in these competitions and bag prizes. Last year our group from Electrical and IT students received 4th position at international level. The students from this group are invited to give orientation of these competitions. This group has worked on HolA Bot( Holonomic Art Robot) for deployment in an arena which is an abstraction of different settings in a Smart City. The objective of this theme is to build a ‚Äúplotter robot‚Äù, i.e. draw shapes using a holonomic drive robot.
