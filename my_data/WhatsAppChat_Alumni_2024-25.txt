02/01/23, 19:58 - Prof. Vijayalaxmi Kanade Teacher pvg: Dear Student/ Fresher,

As everyone knows Industry welcomes knowledgeable job aspirants. *Quality knowledge* is the strength of everyone. Based on my  experience in the IT industries ( MNCs) like TCS, AT & T (USA), Cognizant, Oracle Financial Services etc., I am launching *"Madhusudan Mothe's Python Tips & Job Guidance Community"* where Python & interview tips will be shared. e.g.

 **Q.State True or False.*  **1. Python is a purely object oriented programming language.** 

Many of us feel that the above statement is True, *but in reality the above statement is false*. Reason is that Python supports data types like integer, float etc. Hence,it is not a purely object oriented language. 

I will be sharing such fundamental strong technical tips in order to contribute quality knowledge to the students as part of this initiative. I request to share this message to all your students so that they can join this Whats App group. **Needless to mention, it is a knowledge sharing community and there are no charges to be part of this group.** In order to join this  Whats App group, students can click on below link. 

https://chat.whatsapp.com/HgavqJDlwaE7LmS8dbshHJ Thanks & RegaInbox

*Any student/fresher who is interested in learning tricky Python & Job guidance tips  can join.*

23/08/23, 16:18 - Dr Minakshi Pradeep Atre Pvg: Our institute has established EYantra Embedded Robotics Laboratory in collaboration with IIT Bombay, where laboratory facilities are available to work in this field. Every year EYRC and EYIC competitions are conducted by EYantra team of IIT Bombay. A group of bright students passing through these levels of competition are given high level internship at IIT Bombay and trained for advance technologies in this field. Every year, students from PVG‚Äùs COET & GKPIOM, Pune participate in these competitions and bag prizes. Last year our group from Electrical and IT students received 4th position at international level. The students from this group are invited to give orientation of these competitions. This group has worked on HolA Bot( Holonomic Art Robot) for deployment in an arena which is an abstraction of different settings in a Smart City. The objective of this theme is to build a ‚Äúplotter robot‚Äù, i.e. draw shapes using a holonomic drive robot.

In this session, alumni will explain their project along with the process followed in EYRC competition. I request maximum students to participate in this activity to enhance their knowledge.

We are pleased to inform you that due to the overwhelming response received for our animation hackathon, ANIMATE 2024, we have decided to extend the registration and submission deadline to May 20th, 2024. For registrations visit:¬†https://animate2024.fossee.in/register/.¬†We request you to share the event details through the poster available¬†here¬†with your students.¬†The judging criteria will primarily assess storytelling, presentation, concept, originality of ideas, and the extent of utilization of Synfig Studio's features and techniques.¬†


Listed below are the prize categories:

1st, 2nd, and 3rd prizes

Best regional language

Best innovation

Social relevance

Environmental relevance

Institutions with maximum submissions

Participants stand a chance to win a cash prize of up to Rs. 50,000. Additionally, contributors of the top 100 submissions will be considered for the prestigious Summer School at FOSSEE, IIT Bombay.

We are thrilled to introduce a new category dedicated to acknowledging institutions with the highest number of submissions (item 6 in the above list). In our previous edition, distinguished personalities like veteran Bollywood Director Mr. Subhash Ghai and the current NAAC Chairman Prof. Anil Sahasrabudhe graced our event as chief guests. The award ceremony promises to be an excellent platform for showcasing your institution's dedication to learning.¬†


We encourage you to motivate your students (and faculty) to learn the 2D animation software free of cost using Spoken Tutorial and submit their videos.¬† This will improve their employment potential, and will also unleash their creative abilities.¬† A large participation in activities such as this will also help the institutions to get benefits in the form of NACC accreditation, etc.¬† To help all motivated people, we will conduct regular webinars to address any queries they may have regarding this event or the cutting edge, but freely available, software tools to be used to create the animation.¬† Details of the webinars will be sent to registered participants via email.


We look forward to your continued support.

04/03/25, 10:26 - Prof. Vijayalaxmi Kanade Teacher pvg: Good morning, everyone. 

I request CS, IT, and AI&DS t&p faculty coordinators to ask students to report on 5th March 2025, 10.30 am, at the college auditorium for "2nd session of etraveli group" preplacement talk for HR orientation.

The session is about "1st step towards corporate." On that day, they would like to interact with the students and then followed by that they will come for the recruitment.

Students are advised to do research on the company website and should proceed with the healthy discussion  by asking them questions. 

All details you can check on their website. The tentative package the company offers is 7 LPA+. 

Students attending the session are only eligible to proceed with the recruitment drive.  

Thank you.
Have a nice day ahead.
