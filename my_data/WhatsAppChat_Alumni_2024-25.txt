02/01/23, 19:58 - Prof. Vijayalaxmi Kanade Teacher pvg: Dear Student/ Fresher,

As everyone knows Industry welcomes knowledgeable job aspirants. *Quality knowledge* is the strength of everyone. Based on my  experience in the IT industries ( MNCs) like TCS, AT & T (USA), Cognizant, Oracle Financial Services etc., I am launching *"Madhusudan Mothe's Python Tips & Job Guidance Community"* where Python & interview tips will be shared. e.g.

 **Q.State True or False.*  **1. Python is a purely object oriented programming language.** 

Many of us feel that the above statement is True, *but in reality the above statement is false*. Reason is that Python supports data types like integer, float etc. Hence,it is not a purely object oriented language. 

I will be sharing such fundamental strong technical tips in order to contribute quality knowledge to the students as part of this initiative. I request to share this message to all your students so that they can join this Whats App group. **Needless to mention, it is a knowledge sharing community and there are no charges to be part of this group.** In order to join this  Whats App group, students can click on below link. 

https://chat.whatsapp.com/HgavqJDlwaE7LmS8dbshHJ Thanks & RegaInbox

*Any student/fresher who is interested in learning tricky Python & Job guidance tips  can join.*

विद्यार्थ्यांना मिळालेले संबंधित परिपत्रक हे पूर्णतः फेक असून, कोणी विद्यार्थी असे परिपत्रक फॉरवर्ड करून इतरांची दिशाभूल करत असेल तर त्याच्यावर विद्यापीठाकडून सायबर सेल अंतर्गत कायदेशीर कारवाई करण्यात येईल याची सर्वांनी नोंद घ्यावी.

SE End Sem Exam ही तिच्या नियमित वेळापत्रकाप्रमाणे (25 जानेवारी ते 31 जानेवारी) होईल.

23/08/23, 16:18 - Dr Minakshi Pradeep Atre Pvg: Our institute has established EYantra Embedded Robotics Laboratory in collaboration with IIT Bombay, where laboratory facilities are available to work in this field. Every year EYRC and EYIC competitions are conducted by EYantra team of IIT Bombay. A group of bright students passing through these levels of competition are given high level internship at IIT Bombay and trained for advance technologies in this field. Every year, students from PVG”s COET & GKPIOM, Pune participate in these competitions and bag prizes. Last year our group from Electrical and IT students received 4th position at international level. The students from this group are invited to give orientation of these competitions. This group has worked on HolA Bot( Holonomic Art Robot) for deployment in an arena which is an abstraction of different settings in a Smart City. The objective of this theme is to build a “plotter robot”, i.e. draw shapes using a holonomic drive robot.

In this session, alumni will explain their project along with the process followed in EYRC competition. I request maximum students to participate in this activity to enhance their knowledge.

01/05/24, 11:20 - Prof. Vijayalaxmi Kanade Teacher pvg: Dear Sir/Madam,


We are pleased to inform you that due to the overwhelming response received for our animation hackathon, ANIMATE 2024, we have decided to extend the registration and submission deadline to May 20th, 2024. For registrations visit: https://animate2024.fossee.in/register/. We request you to share the event details through the poster available here with your students. The judging criteria will primarily assess storytelling, presentation, concept, originality of ideas, and the extent of utilization of Synfig Studio's features and techniques. 


Listed below are the prize categories:

1st, 2nd, and 3rd prizes

Best regional language

Best innovation

Social relevance

Environmental relevance

Institutions with maximum submissions

Participants stand a chance to win a cash prize of up to Rs. 50,000. Additionally, contributors of the top 100 submissions will be considered for the prestigious Summer School at FOSSEE, IIT Bombay.

We are thrilled to introduce a new category dedicated to acknowledging institutions with the highest number of submissions (item 6 in the above list). In our previous edition, distinguished personalities like veteran Bollywood Director Mr. Subhash Ghai and the current NAAC Chairman Prof. Anil Sahasrabudhe graced our event as chief guests. The award ceremony promises to be an excellent platform for showcasing your institution's dedication to learning. 


We encourage you to motivate your students (and faculty) to learn the 2D animation software free of cost using Spoken Tutorial and submit their videos.  This will improve their employment potential, and will also unleash their creative abilities.  A large participation in activities such as this will also help the institutions to get benefits in the form of NACC accreditation, etc.  To help all motivated people, we will conduct regular webinars to address any queries they may have regarding this event or the cutting edge, but freely available, software tools to be used to create the animation.  Details of the webinars will be sent to registered participants via email.


We look forward to your continued support.

During the conference, we had the opportunity to attend insightful sessions by several renowned speakers. A strong start to the 
conference was done by Dr. Booshan Kelkar, in their speech titled *"AI: Play Along",* where he discussed the applications, benefits, challenges, and limitations of AI in Physical Education.

We proceeded to give our presentation in the presence of Dr. Rupesh Thopate, Dr. Manisha Kondhare and *Dr. Prof. Namdev Banne, from PVG's COET* their insights were wonderful and gave us a deeper understanding of our study ,we thoroughly enjoyed this experience and are grateful for the BC2AD team for this opportunity.
